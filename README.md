# Quadmac
This is a Zetamac clone but for factorising quadratic equations. Currently there is no backend state. It is coded for personal use only, and for me, a way to experiment with SolidJS (it is really good!).

Find a deployed version of the site [here](effervescent-vacherin-5be59e.netlify.app). Any issues are welcome!

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
